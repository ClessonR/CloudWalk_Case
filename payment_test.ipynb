    "## Common Findings in Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most common findings when identifying fraud in credit card data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unusual Transaction Amounts**: Transactions that are significantly higher or lower than the average transaction amounts.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Transactions in a Short Time Frame**: Numerous transactions occurring within a very short period.\n",
    "3. **Transactions from Different Geographic Locations**: Transactions made from locations that are significantly different from the cardholder’s usual locations.\n",
    "4. **Inconsistent Merchant Categories**: Purchases from merchant categories that are unusual for the cardholder.\n",
    "5. **Odd Hours Transactions**: Transactions made at times that are unusual for the cardholder.\n",
    "6. **Frequent Chargebacks**: A high number of chargebacks associated with the cardholder's account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions to Ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Are there any transactions that significantly deviate from the cardholder’s typical spending patterns?**\n",
    "2. **Are there clusters of transactions occurring in a very short period?**\n",
    "3. **Do any transactions originate from geographic locations far from the cardholder’s usual area?**\n",
    "4. **Are there purchases from merchant categories that are atypical for the cardholder?**\n",
    "5. **Do any transactions occur at odd hours, compared to the cardholder’s normal activity?**\n",
    "6. **Is there a high frequency of chargebacks, and what are the reasons for these chargebacks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the questions must be answered perfectly, but now I've a guide. **So, let's prepare the data.**"

This aspect requires deeper analysis to discern patterns and potential implications.\n",

To detect potential instances of this, I will analyze transactions with similar amounts occurring within the same merchant and occurring within a short timeframe, approximately 30 minutes.\n",
