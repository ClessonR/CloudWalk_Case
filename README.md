# Payment Detection Test Case

### Clesson Roberto da Silva Junior
**This project aims to showcase my technical skills and solve a problem similar to those faced by the company.**

## Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing in this project is the detection of fraudulent payments in a financial system. We need to develop an algorithm that can accurately identify suspicious transactions and flag them for further investigation. This is crucial for preventing financial losses and maintaining the integrity of the system.

The analysis and full solution may be found in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ClessonR/CloudWalk_Case/blob/main/payment_test.ipynb), and some [discursive questions](https://github.com/ClessonR/CloudWalk_Case/blob/main/Task_3_Answers%20Payment%20Analysis%20Test%20Case.pdf) are found in the **pdf.**

I also took liberty to recommend some **app improvements** to [InfinitePay](https://github.com/ClessonR/CloudWalk_Case/blob/main/infinite_pay_suggestion.png).
